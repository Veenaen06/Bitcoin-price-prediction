The project name is Bitcoin Price Prediction. 
It involves forecasting the feture value of Bitcoin based on historical data, market trends, technical indicators and external factors. 
It helps traders, investors, and analysts make informed decisions by estimating the cryptocurrency's 
price movement.

This project was done using LSTM model.
Long Short-Term Memory is a Deep learning method and a specialized type of Recurrent neural network designed to handle sequential data and capture long-term dependencies effectively.
It is widely used in time series forecasting like bitcoin price prediction due to its ability to learn from past sequences and predict future needs.

âœ¨Programming Language :Python 
Required libraries :

* pandas
* numpy
* matplot
* datetime
* scikit-learn
* MinMaxScaler
* tenserflow etc.....
In this project,first we download the historical datasets that is available in online. 
then load that dataset and check for null values. 
Then we split data into training and testing set.
